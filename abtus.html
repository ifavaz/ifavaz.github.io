                    <p style="text-align: justify;">“EVE” is the culmination of the visionary dream of our Chairman and Founder
                        Member Mr. Hussain Mohamed
                        Fulhu. It had its humble beginnings as a sole proprietorship in 1994, whose name was synonymous with
                        ready
                        made garments, especially various brands of jeans, both in the retail as well as wholesale industry.
                        In retrospect, as the years progressed with the ever changing demand for garments in the Maldivian
                        market,
                        EVE too expanded. EVE SALE - a shop dedicated to selling low-cost garments and EVE SHINE - a shop
                        dedicated
                        to selling fashion accessories were introduced into the market.</p>

                </div>
            </div>


            <p style="text-align: justify;"> However, by 2006, as the fashion market in Maldives changed, all
                shops under the EVE banner closed except
                for EVE SALES. Today EVE SALE continues to uphold the name and legacy of the era, being used
                primarily as a
                showroom for our EVR GARMENT Products.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, EVE GROUP OF COMPANIES has set hold in the Maldivian
                        business community through its sister
                        companies, namely EVE GARMENTS PVT LTD, EVE CUSHION PVT LTD, and EVE CONSTRUCTION PVT LTD. Each
                        company has
                        its distinctive business style and functionality - engaging with the business community and

            <p style="text-align: justify;">EVE GARMENTS PVT LTD was introduced with the aim of making school activity
                uniform, which is sold in EVE
                SALES Shop. Since initiation, production has been in-house; primarily in our factories. EVE CUSHIONS PVT
                LTD
                was established as our upholstery and canvas manufacturing unit. It serves individual customers and
                takes
                orders for bulk production. EVE CONSTRUCTION PVT LTD was established with a vision to lead in the field
                of
                civil construction, by providing the best service to the fulfillment of all our clients. Being small but
                steady in the beginning, many projects of varied complexities have been archived.</p>
